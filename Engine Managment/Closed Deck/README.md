# ClosedDeck

ClosedDeck is a hardware shield designed to use an Arduino Mega as the central microcontroller unit (MCU), thereby enabling it to operate as a standalone engine management system. This functionality is achieved when the shield is coupled with compatible firmware from an open-source project called Speeduino, developed by Josh Stewart.
